Zend_Service_ChartLyrics
------------------------

---------------
* Introduction
---------------
This is my first GitHub repository, so I needed a small project to test it with.
As I was already working on the Zend_Service_ChartLyrics proposal, this tiny project
seemed to be a good candidate.

Regards,
Maghiel

* ChartLyrics Lyrics API
-------------------------
"The ChartLyrics API supports both the SOAP and GET protocol. Allowing users to search
for lyrics using the artist name, song title or lyric text as search query."
...
"Our Simple Object Access Protocol Application Programming Interface is available to
developers and end users who wish to use our database for their music project,
website or application."

* Zend_Service_ChartLyrics
---------------------------
Zend_Service_ChartLyrics is a SOAP client wrapper for the Chartlyrics API.

Currently the component is a proposal draft.
